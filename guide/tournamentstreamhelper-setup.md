# TournamentStreamHelper Setup

## Setting up Files

{% hint style="info" %}
I recommend placing all extracted files into a single folder to stay organized. Let's call this folder the "working folder" to simplify things. For example, create a :file\_folder: `Wolfie Wars` folder for everything and put it somewhere in your computer that is quicker for you to access.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the :file\_cabinet:`TournamentStreamHelper-x.xx.zip` archive and extract (dragging out) :file\_folder: `TournamentStreamHelper-x.xx` to :file\_folder: `Wolfie Wars`.
2. Rename the folder to :file\_folder: `TournamentStreamHelper`.
3. Extract the contents from :file\_cabinet: `TournamentStreamHelper.zip` (downloaded from the stream assets drive) to :file\_folder: `Wolfie Wars`. Replace all files when prompted.

## Running TSH and Downloading Game Assets

1. Open the :file\_folder: `TournamentStreamHelper` folder and run the **TSH** executable.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you got a Windows Firewall pop-up, click on **Show more** and make sure both networks are ticked, then click **Allow**.
{% endhint %}

3. Select **Super Smash Bros Ultimate** from the dropdown list, then click on the first asset pack and then **Download**.

**(Optional)** Once the base asset pack is downloaded, you can now select and download any additional asset packs. I recommend downloading at least the **Full** asset pack for Smash Ultimate.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful with downloading multiple packs at once as the download size will be very large and it will take a while to finish depending on your internet speed. However, you will not be able to use TSH at all until the download is complete.
{% endhint %}

4. Once the downloads are done, close the Download assets window.
5. On the top-left side of TSH, click on the empty dropdown menu and select **Super Smash Bros Ultimate**.

## Linking Start.gg to TSH
